# ctd-prework-assignment  

This was a personal project I started back in late 2022 called audio anthology. I intended for the project to be a sort of personal music blog / archive for myself, and was planning to use the Spotify API to try and display what I was listening to live. I dropped the project as my coursework ramped up, but I was more than happy to revisit it for the prework assignment using the Spotify API.  

The repository has a GitHub Pages deployment; this should be all you need to open the website. Once opened, you can click on any of the preset albums to display their information, or use the search bars to search for an album to display its info.  

Further down, you can also search for the name of an artist and view their most recent albums.
